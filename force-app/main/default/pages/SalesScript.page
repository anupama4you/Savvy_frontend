                        <li>Show your personality, have a joke and really have fun on the phones. Have fun and don?t be afraid to be human, open up, if they don?t talk much, then you must. If they are big talkers, let them talk?. but make sure you still control the call!  </li>

                        <li>Find similarities with your customers, try and find one thing in common with every customer you deal with. You will be surprised how similar all of us are.   </li>
                        <li>The client must LIKE you. If the customer really likes you they will allow you to re-quote and WIN the business. This will only happen if you have a good relationship with your customer, this relationship can only happen through phone time ? through MEANINGFUL conversations!! A 5-minute convo consisting of just repayment and finance details will not cut it. PHONE TIME is so important. Take the time to get to know the person you are speaking to. </li>

            <!-- <p>Hi John, its Bill from Savvy. Congratulations your loan has been approved.</p> -->
            <p>Great!</p>
            <!-- <p>I am happy to advise that they have also approved the inclusion of the protection benefits that we spoke about when you first enquired.</p>
            <p>Fantastic!</p>
            <p><strong>If the customer asks what the protected payments are? You Say...If they don’t you move straight into Next Step &amp; Vehicles Direct</strong></p>
            <i>
                <p>The protection benefits include 3 options you can choose from:</p>
                <p><strong>1.  Repayment Cover</strong></p>
                <p>This provides cover if you happen to be ill or injured and unable to work. It could be a sporting injury such as a broken arm or an illness such as glandular fever.  Your payments will be made for you whilst you are unable to go to work and it gives you the option of handing back the vehicle. Also, if you become involuntarily unemployed the payments will be paid until you can find another job. The policy will cover you for the whole term of the loan and provides unlimited claims.</p>
                <p><strong>2. There is also Shortfall Cover</strong></p>
                <p>If you write your car off during the term of the loan and the payout from your insurer is insufficient to payout your loan, shortfall cover will pay the difference plus provide an additional cash payment directly to you. The Cash benefit is up to $4,000 and this will be paid even if there is no GAP payout.</p>
                <p><strong>3. The third benefit is Mechanical Breakdown</strong></p>
                <p>If your car breaks down and requires repair, this benefit will cover the cost of parts and labour to repair your vehicle. Just about every mechanical and electronic component is covered for up to 5 years. Other benefits include no excess on claims, you can claim up to the market value of the car, accommodation, hire car, towing and parts guaranteed are all additional benefits.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we have plenty of time to decide on any protection package you might like to take. Before we generate loan contacts I will be sending you a detailed features and benefits presentation and at that point we can discuss them in more detail.</p>
            </i>
             -->

        <div id="InvoiceRequested">
            <div>
                <p>Now that we have requested the invoice from the dealership/documents from seller, we?re getting closer to organizing your loan documents, as previously discussed our loan products come with protection options. It?s now time for me to run through all the available options in detail and make sure you understand them all so you can make an informed decision on what package would suit you best. I have already sent you your features and benefits presentation, can you please bring this up?  </p>    
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>So first of all, let me just confirm, you have purchased (car details) for (purchase price) and we?re financing that over (loan term) with (residual) is this correct? (**We confirm this at the start to get them in the mode of saying ?yes?)</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><u><strong>GAP</strong></u></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The first thing to run through with you is GAP protection. Have you heard of the before? Do you know what that covers? It?s something that most people take out when they finance cars these days just because your insurance company will be de-valuing your car quicker than you?re paying back the finance. Because if your car is written off or stolen your insurance company only pays you out for the market value of your car, meaning if you do find yourself in the unfortunate situation of having your vehicle written off or stolen, once you?ve recovered from the shock of not having a car anymore you?ll usually be hit with a more painful shock being that not only do you not have a car anymore, but you still owe your bank or finance company an quantity of money because your insurance company has only partially paid out your loan. So the GAP protection will ensure for you that your loan will always be paid out. It covers the financial shortfall between what your insurance company pays you out, and the amount owing on the finance, up to a threshold of $X. In addition to that, you will also be provided $X cash to cover all your out of pocket expenses in the meantime such as car hire, taxis, comprehensive insurance excess, all those additional expenses. This will ensure you?re never off the road and not paying out of your own pocket to do so. Any questions in regard to the GAP protection.</p>
            </div>

                <p><u><strong>LTI</strong></u></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The next thing to run through is loan protection. If you ever fall into a circumstance outside of your control that could impair your ability to repay the loan due to illness, injury, involuntary unemployment, divorce, driving restrictive medical condition, or international job transfer, you will initially have up to (3 or 6) months of loan payments covered for you while you get yourself back on your feet. If your still out of action beyond that period, then you will be provided the option of handing the car back. Any residual value between what the car is valued at at that point and what is owing on the finance would be covered, you will be relinquished from responsibility for the loan with no damage to your credit file if you exercise that option. Any questions in regard to loan protection?</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><u><strong>Platinum or diamond Warranty</strong></u></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The final level of protection we can provide is a warranty for your vehicle. Our warranty is what is called an exclusions warranty. An exclusions warranty covers absolutely everything on the car, only excluding wear and tear. Absolutely everything else on the car is completely covered, everything from your engine block all the way down to your power window motors. You have all parts and labor covered anywhere in Australia, and you even have lots of extras covered for you as well such as towing, or emergency accommodation if your car is immobilized away from home, you also have locksmith services covered for if you lose or break your key, or lock your key in your car, and if anything serious goes wrong with the car and your car is in the workshop for 30days or more, then the warranty will even cover your loan repayment for you whilst your car is off the road so it is a very comprehensive product. Any questions in regard to anything in the warranty?</p>

Each Monthly Repayment was $1,000 and You were away from work for less than 3 months following the completion of the Non-Benefit Period ($3,000 in total was paid to Your Financier). As a result of the Trauma You elect to Hand Back the Vehicle to the Dealer. The value of the Vehicle as reasonably determined by Us is $22,000* and the Payout Figure is $35,000. You have a Shortfall of $13,000. We will pay the Financier $12,000 being the lesser of the Shortfall and Level 2 Cover of $15,000 less the $3,000 Additional Monthly Payment Option claim made one year ago. *Vehicle value is determined in accordance with the mid point between retail and trade value of the current edition of the Glasses Guide Auto Edge, for a Vehicle which is the equivalent age, make, condition and model as Your Vehicle. </p>

I’ll go over each item you’ve been quoted by this other company, in other words I will compare apples with apples, and if everything is equal, Ill see if I can do even better on that. If I can, you’ll get an even better deal and if I can’t, Ill tell you so. Either way, you’ll win. Now, do you have that other quote in front of you?

                                        <p>[Isolate the objection before answering it] I understand John, and let me ask you a question. Assuming the price on this car loan weren’t an issue, is this the solution you feel is right for you today? Or ‘Is this something you would go ahead and move forward with today?</p>
                                        <p>[How easy is that. Any answer other than “YES” means that this is just a smokescreen and not the real objection. If that’s the case, then it’s up to you to do more probing here to find out exactly what is stopping them from moving forward].</p>
                                        <p>[If, however, they say yes, price is the only thing holding them back, then you move into the following].</p>
                                        <p>Ok great, John. Lets work together to get this working for you today then. First of all, where does our price need to be for you to move forward with us today?</p>
                                        <p>[If your prospect gives you a price that you can reach, then before you just agree to terms , you must first get commitment for your prospect that this is something they are going to move forward with today – assuming you can meet those terms. If you can match that price they are willing to pay, say:]</p>
                                        <p>Ok, now John, that price (and terms) are going to need some approval on my end and I’ll go get that right now, but before I do, let me make sure that if I can get you (review the details), then this is something you-re prepared to move forward with today, right? </p>
                                        <p>[Only after they agree to the deal should you put them on hold or hang up and call back in 5 minutes and make the appropriate arrangements. After you’ve done that, come back on the line and say:]</p>
                                        <p>Ok, that’s all done on this end, so congratulations. Here’s what we need to do now……then close the sale.</p>

                                        <p>Bill I get what’s your saying, I know you have a lot of options out there, it’s not the first time a customer has told me they want keep looking around in hope of a better deal. What we’ve found is that customers who tend to go out looking for a better deal will always end up coming back as this is what we specialise in.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Away response</strong>, In the end this just takes up more time and quite often ends in frustration as your back where you’re started except 2 steps behind. So wouldn’t you prefer to save yourself from that outcome by getting pre approval right now?</p>
                                        <p><strong>Towards response</strong>, personally I would prefer to more effectively make use of your time getting your application approved so you can enjoy driving around in your new car. If you’re as excited as I think you are about getting your new ……Make of vehicle…… I would love to help out by organising your pre approval.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Last resort</strong>, The true difference between most lenders is minimal at best. Here at Savvy we prefer to be honest and upfront with our client from the beginning and if you do choose to get another quote, (which is fine) let us know so we can compare apples with apples. I’m more than certain you will find yourself better off with us every time. </p>
                                        <p>Look at this point it makes sense to submit your pre approval so I can get to work on what’s Import to you which is making sure you actually get your new car, so what do you say we make this happen.</p>

Anyway, I have sent you through some testimonials from several customers that have had some great experiences

                                    John, many customers say the same thing and your right, if you have the savings in the bank, then you can cover the GAP but do you want to? GAP’s a good investment.  On an average 25K loan, 2.5 years into the loan contract would generally give you 5K GAP, would you prefer to pay 5K in one lump sum, or pay $4 a week over 5 years, think about what most people waste $4 a week on. I think it’s a great investment, out of all the protection packages, this is the one that most people take out as it deliver you great coverage for a small weekly cost. So what do you think?

                                    I agree, the interest rate that is charged with a non-conforming loan is very high, it’s because of the extra risk involved because of the issues you on your credit file in the past. These financiers are prepared to give you a second chance and help you build you credit score when other financiers do not. 
                                </p>

                                    This facility however should only be used as a short-term fix, once you have delivered a few years’ worth of strong repayment history and your credit score increases we can look to refinance you into a new facility with prime rates.

                                I can understand that you would like to know what the interest rate will be, as previously mentioned I cannot provide you with the exact rate because it does work on a ‘rate for risk’ basis and every deal is priced on its own merits. Due to the credit issues you have had in the past these specialist lenders do charge a premium, the rate could be anywhere in between 15% - 29%. The best way to assess the cost associated however is to assess the repayments because generally they usually work out quite affordable to the borrower. Based on your ‘Loan Amount’ your repayment will be approximately ‘repayment’

                                    Unfortunately, because you have had issues with your credit file there is no set rate that I can tell you at this point. Once I have submitted your application to a lender and they have assessed the risk, they then will provide us with an interest rate and repayment. Once I have gathered up all your information I will then be able to come back to you with an exact rate and repayment. At that point you can decide if you want to proceed or not. This application is no obligation so if you are not comfortable with your repayments you can decide not to proceed at any point.

                                    To give you an idea though on a 10K loan your looking at around $80 per week, or $160 per week on a 20K loan. This would be worst case.

                                    That’s great, this is where this car loan can help put your self into a position whereby when you are ready to take out a home loan you have proven to lenders that you are credit worthy through a good repayment history on this loan.

                                    You see at the moment, you are paying a higher rate on a smaller loan amount which does not have so much of an impact on repayments, however if you don’t look to improve your credit rating and then go for a non-conforming home loan which is usually 3-4%. The interest you will paying on $400,000 home loan with a higher rate will hurt a lot more that a higher rate on a smaller lend.
